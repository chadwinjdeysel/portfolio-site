So yeah, I can really jam with this. I'm able to get to a point where I can create a site pretty quickly without needing too much
hand holding or anything.

## Perks of this:

1. Good DevX
2. Simple and straight forward
3. P E R F O R M A N C E!

```csharp
public static void Main() {
    Console.Writeline("Hello World")
}
```
